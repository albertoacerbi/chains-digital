# Repository chains-digital

This repository will contain all the material related to the project "From storytelling to Facebook. Does the medium of transmission change which content is successful?"

The project involve two online experiments (N=540; N=600). The first tests the effect of three cognitive factors of attraction/content biases (negative content, disgust, threat related information) with a "traditional" transmission chain methdology.

The second uses the same material, but will ask to participants simply to decide whether they would share it or not, in two conditions: anonymously in a large social networks, or with their contacts in their favourite social network.

For the time being, more information can be found in the document (in progress) "preregstration-plan".
